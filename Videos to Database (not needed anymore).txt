https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/upload-video-file-audio-file-and-image-file-in-sql-server-db1

Need to find a way which videos are avaliable to each person in database

Create table Member
(
MemberID Int identity,    (PK)
FirstName
LastName
......
)

Create table SharedVideos
(
SharedVideoID Int identity     (PK)
MemberID Int (FK)
VideoID
)

Create table Videos
(
 VideoID Int identity,     (PK)
Video varbinary(MAX),
Video_Name nvarchar(50),
Video_Size bigint
)

For Uploading Videos we need varbinary(Max) to be able to upload videos  (Not sure if there is a limit)




Need to share videos to each person seperately of choice

Shared  Yoga Videos (Maybe need a different name)



-    Needs to be able to have multiple videos per person if they manage to buy many
-    Client needs to be able to pick which video(s) the person is able to view
